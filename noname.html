As of 2011, the city had a population of 3.1 million, making it the tenth most populous city in the country. Jaipur is also known as the Pink City, due to the dominant colour scheme of its buildings. It is also known as the Paris of India, and Dr. C.V. Raman called it the Island of Glory. It is located 268 km (167 miles) from the national capital New Delhi. On 6 July 2019, UNESCO World Heritage Committee inscribed Jaipur the "Pink City of India" among its World Heritage Sites. Jaipur was founded in 1727 by the Kacchawa Rajput ruler Jai Singh II,[10][11] the ruler of Amer, after whom the city is named. It was one of the earliest planned cities of modern India, designed by Vidyadhar Bhattacharya.[12] During the British Colonial period, the city served as the capital of Jaipur State. After independence in 1947, Jaipur was made the capital of the newly formed state of Rajasthan.  </p>

   <article style="width:55%;float:Left;font-size:1px"> <b><p style="color:Brown;font-family:'Brush Script MT',cursive;font-size:10px;letter-spacing:0px;">The city of Jaipur was founded by King of Amer, Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II on 18 November 1727, who ruled from 1699 to 1743. He planned to shift his capital from Amer, 11 kilometres (7 mi) to Jaipur to accommodate the growing population and increasing scarcity of water.[12] Jai Singh consulted several books on architecture and architects while planning the layout of Jaipur. Under the architectural guidance of Vidyadhar Bhattacharya, Jaipur was planned based on the principles of Vastu Shastra and Shilpa Shastra.[15] The construction of the city began in 1726 and took four years to complete the major roads, offices, and palaces. The city was divided into nine blocks, two of which contained the state buildings and palaces, with the remaining seven allotted to the public. Huge ramparts were built, pierced by seven fortified gates.[12]
   
   During the rule of Sawai Ram Singh I, the city was painted pink to welcome HRH Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (who later became King Edward VII, Emperor of India), in 1876.[16] Many of the avenues still remain painted in pink, giving Jaipur a distinctive appearance and the epithet Pink city.[17]
   
   In the 19th century, the city grew rapidly and by 1900 it had a population of 160,000. The wide boulevards were paved and its chief industries were the working of metals and marble, fostered by a school of art founded in 1868.[11] The city had three colleges, including a Sanskrit college (1865) and a girls' school (1867) opened during the reign of the Maharaja Ram Singh II.[18][19]
   
   Large areas of the city including the airport were flooded in August 1981, resulting in the death of eight people and much damage to the city's Dravyavati River.[20] The floods were caused by three days of cloud burst that produced more rain than the annual average.[21]</article></p></b>

   <article style="width:55%;float:Left;font-size:1px"> <b><p style="color:Brown;font-family:'Brush Script MT',cursive;font-size:5px;letter-spacing:0px;">Jaipur, the capital city of the Indian state of Rajasthan is situated in the eastern border of Thar Desert, a semi-arid land. This state is one of the biggest of the country which shares the international boundary with Pakistan on the western side. Jaipur is popularly known as the pink city and is one of the well-planned cities in India, apparently, also the first. It is positioned at an altitude of 1417 feet above the sea level. On three sides, the city is enclosed by the Aravali hills and this is why, it is safeguarded from the rough desert. In the north, it is surrounded by Sikar and Mahendragarh district; in the south by Tonk; in the east by Alwar, Dausa and Sawai Madhopur; and in the west by Nagaur and Ajmer district.
   
   The total length of Jaipur extending from east to west is about 180 km whereas the width from north to south is about 110 km. The main rivers passing through the Jaipur are Banganga and Sabi. About 28.65 million cubic meter ground water resources are available in Jaipur. To provide the drinking water to the old city, there is Ramgarh dam on the River Ban Ganga. The main minerals of the city are copper, iron, dolomite, white marble, glass and silicon. Sambhar Lake, which is the only natural lake with salty water is also the leading source of good quality of salt in the state as well as country, is very close to Jaipur.
   
   The city is well-known among pre-modern cities for the width and evenness of the streets which are divided into six sectors separated by broad streets of 34 m (111 ft.) wide. These sectors are called as urban quarters which are further segmented by the network of interconnecting streets. Around the east, west and south sides of a central Palace quarter, five quarters enfold with a sixth one right away to the east. This Palace quarter surrounds a sprawling palace complex i.e. Hawa Mahal, formal gardens, and a small lake. The Aravali hill in the northwest end of the Jaipur is crowned by the Nahargarh Fort which was once the home of the King Sawai Jai Singh II. From the location of Jaipur, one is able to reach the other main cities of the country through the various means of transport. One can easily reach Delhi, Agra and other nearby cities through the network of roads, air and rail.</article></p></b>
